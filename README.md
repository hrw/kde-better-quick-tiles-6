# Better Quick Tiles for Plasma 6

This is a fork of 
[Better Quick Tiles by Torge Kummerow](https://store.kde.org/p/1515244) done for
Plasma 6.

Allows to quickly send windows via shortcuts to different locations on a 3x2
grid. Pressing the same shortcut multiple times can even cycle through modes
like 1/2 of screen, 1/3rd of screen or 2/3rd of screen.

By default it allocates the Meta+Num+1-9 keys for all directions of the screen.
If your system does not recognize Meta+Num shortcut keys then you need Qt 6.6.2
or newer.

It is also recommended to assign the already existing "window to next/previous
screen" keys to move windows between screens on a multi monitor setups.
